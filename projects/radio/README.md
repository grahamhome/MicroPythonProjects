### Radio Communication

#### Status: Not Working, WIP

#### Overview
The goal of this project is to find and learn to use a MicroPython library 
for the FM radio modules I have.
I want to be able to send and recieve arbitrary data between Pi Pico units. 
I plan to write a component class to simplify the use of my chosen library.

#### Blockers
I only have one Pico that can interface with my radios right now. 
The other one mysteriously does not. 
I am waiting for another Pico to arrive before I can continue with this project.
