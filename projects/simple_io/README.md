### My First Pico Projects

#### Status: Assumed working, no longer in development

#### Overview
These scripts are a collection of simple experiments with GPIO pins I performed when first learning the Pico.
They should all work since they only rely on builtin classes, 
but they are not intended to be examples of good coding or design!
